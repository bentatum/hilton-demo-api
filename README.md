# Hilton API demo

There are multiple branches for your consideration.

#### GraphQL

I saw GraphQL mentioned in the job description, I thought it might be helpful to see this api implemented as a GraphQL endpoint.

You can inspect docs at https://api-demo.benjtatum.com/graphiql

#### Master
This branch has the basic requirements outlined in the exam.

`GET /reservation/:id - returns a single reservation`

`POST /reservation - creates a new reservation`

`GET /reservations - return all reservations`

You can test this at  http://hilton-basic.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com
